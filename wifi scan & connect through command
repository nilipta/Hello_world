Command Line
Believe it or not, this isn’t as challenging as it might seem. I will demonstrate how this is done on a Ubuntu machine. For other distributions you might have to alter the location of scripts or the name.

What you will need, in order to be able to establish this connection, are the following:

ifconfig: Enable your wireless device.
iwlist: List the available wireless access points.
iwconfig: Configure your wireless connection.
dhclient: Get your IP Address via dhcp.
wpa_supplicant: For use with WPA authentication.
Make sure you have all of the above tools onÂ¬â€  your computer before you continue. To test for this tools you can, from within your terminal window, issue the commands:

which ifconfig
which iwlist
which iwconfig
which dhclient
which wpa_supplicant
You should see the path where each tool is installed. If you receive an error that a command is not installed you will need to install it. This should not be the case, since these are standard tools that are required for wireless networking.

Let’s take a look at how this is done when you are connecting to a non-WPA authentication-based wireless network.

Now that you have confirmed they are installed start off with the command:

ifconfig wlan0 up

Where wlan0 is the name of your wireless device (this is most often the default). The above command will bring your wireless device up so it is ready to use. The next phase is to scan for any wireless access points with the command:

iwlist wlan0 scan

From the output of the scan you should see a line (or lines) like:

ESSID: "NETWORK_NAME"

Where NETWORK_NAME is the name of an available wireless network.

Now that you have your network name (and you know it’s available) you can connect to that network with the command:

iwconfig wlan0 essid NETWORK_NAME key WIRELESS_KEY

Where NETWORK_NAME is the name of the network you want to connect to and WIRELESS_KEY is the security key for that network. NOTE: The iwconfig command defaults to HEX values for wireless keys. If you need to use ascii you have to prepend the “s” prefix to your key like so:

iwconfig wlan0 essid NETWORK_NAME key s:WIRELESS_KEY

With your connection made, you now have to get an IP address for your machine using the dhclient command like:

dhclient wlan0

Simplify the Process
Naturally you do not want to have to issue all of those command in order to bring up a wireless network. You can make this a lot easier by creating a script to handle the task. A possible script might look like this:

#! /bin/bash
ifconfig wlan0
iwconfig wlan0 essid NETWORK_NAME key WIRELESS_KEY
dhclient wlan0

Where NETWORK_NAME and WIRELESS_KEY are unique to the network you are connecting to. Save that file with the name wireless_up and give it executable permissions with the command chmod u+x wireless_up and you are ready to use that file to bring up your wireless. You can even move that file to /usr/local/bin so the command is global. All you would have to do to bring up your wireless connection is issue the command wireless_up and you’re ready to go.

WPA

For WPA-based networks you will need to take a different approach. Do the following:

1. Issue the command wpa_passphrase SSID PASSWORDÂ¬â€ (Where SSID is your network ID and PASSWORD is your wireless password). This will generate a psk string that you will use in the configuration file.

2. Edit the /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf file to reflect:

Network={

Â¬â€ Â¬â€  ssid=SSID

Â¬â€ Â¬â€  psk=PSK

}

Where SSID is the actual ID of your wireless network and PSK is the string generated by the wpa_passphrase command.

3. Run the wpa_supplicant daemon with the command:

wpa_supplicant -B -i INTERFACE -DWext -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf

Where INTERFACE is the name of your wireless interface.

4. Now make sure you are associated with your network with the command iwconfig INTERFACE (Where INTERFACE is the name of your wireless interface).

5. Get an IP address with the command: dhclient INTERFACE (Where INTERFACE is the name of your wireless interface).

You should now be on the wireless network.

You can automate this by creating an entry in /etc/network/interfaces like this:

auto INTERFACE

iface INTERFACE inet dhcp

Â¬â€ Â¬â€  pre-up wpa_supplicant -Bw -Dwext -i INTERFACE -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf

Â¬â€ Â¬â€ post-down killall -q wpa_supplicant

Where INTERFACE is the name of your wireless interface.Â¬â€
